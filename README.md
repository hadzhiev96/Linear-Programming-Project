# Linear Programming and Convex Optimization: An Introduction

## Overview
Optimization is a fundamental concept across various fields, from mathematics and computer science to operations research and engineering. Its applications span multiple industries, including aerospace, chemical, electrical, mechanical, finance, and e-commerce, making it essential for solving real-world problems efficiently.

This project introduces and demonstrates the power and practical applications of linear programming and convex optimization. While optimization techniques are vast and complex, this project aims to provide a concise introduction to these methods and how they can be used effectively.

## Objectives

### Understand the Basics of Optimization
- Learn the underlying logic and process of linear programming and convex optimization.
- Understand the role of optimization in modeling systems and improving outcomes.

### Solve Example Problems
- A sample problem will be solved to illustrate the concepts and application of linear programming.
- Gain hands-on experience with the theory by working through a practical example.

### Real-World Applications in Finance
- After covering the fundamentals, we'll explore how linear programming can be applied to real-world financial optimization problems.
- See how these techniques can be leveraged to optimize decision-making in industries like finance.

### Explore Future Possibilities and Limitations
- Reflect on the limitations of linear programming and where further research and optimization techniques may be needed.
